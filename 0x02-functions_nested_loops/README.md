#  Functions, nested loops
 Project done during **full stack software engineering studies at ALX SCHOOL.
it aims to learn about header files,functions loops and nested loops in *C* language

# Technologies
 C files are compiled using gcc 4.8.4
 C files written according to the C90 standard
 Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS


# files
All of the following files are written in program language C
 filename  | Description
  0-putchar.c | prints _putchar|
  1-alphabet.c | prints the alphabet, in lowercase|
  2-print_alphabet_x10.c | prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase|
  3-islower.c | checks for lowercase character|
  4-isalpha.c | checks for alphabetic character|
